Patched app.js (v4_fast tuning)
- Faster wheel zoom (Alt/Ctrl turbo, Shift fine, deltaMode normalization)
- Sharper final image: full render forces step=1
- Default internal resolution fallback changed from 0.5 to 1.0 (if slider value missing)

Replacements performed:
- step block replacements: 1
- wheel speed replacements: 1
